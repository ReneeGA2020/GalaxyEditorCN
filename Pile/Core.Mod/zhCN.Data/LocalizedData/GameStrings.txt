Missile/BlendAtNotGreaterThanStopAt=BlendAt[%1] not > StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phases[%4, %5].  The blend out termination distance of a given phase must be at a further distance than the stop distance of the prior phase.
Missile/CannotHaveBlendOnFinalPhase=Cannot have blend on final phase.  Mover[%1]. /// Cannot have blend on final phase.  Mover[%1].
Missile/CannotHaveNegativeOutroRanges=Cannot have negative outro ranges.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2]. /// Cannot have negative outro ranges.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/CannotHaveZeroStopAtDistanceOnZeroethPhase=Cannot have 0 stopAt distance on zeroeth phase if there is more than 1 phase.  Mover[%1]. /// Cannot have 0 stopAt distance on zeroeth phase if there is more than 1 phase.  Mover[%1].

Missile/EmptyThrowVector=Empty throw vector.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2]. /// Empty throw vector.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/InvalidPitchThrowBand=Invalid pitch throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2]. /// Invalid pitch throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/InvalidYawThrowBand=Invalid yaw throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2]. /// Invalid yaw throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/NoMotionDriver=No motion driver.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2]. /// No motion driver.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAt=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[0].  The distance at which a phase completely stops must be at or past the distance at which the phase starts to blend out.
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  The distance at which a phase completely stops must be at or past the distance at which the phase starts to blend out.
Missile/UnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Unsupported - negative BlendAt[%1] and positive StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  Cannot specify the start of a blend out for a phase with respect to the target, while simultaneously specifying the final stop distance of that phase with respect to the launch point.  This would create varying and probably unexpected behaviors as launch and target points varied in distance from one another.
Missile/UnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CMoverMissile[%1]; 发射物仅支持地面高度地图。空中高度地图使得飞行单位能够平稳飞越悬崖--它不会对发射物起到任何辅助作用，并且仅对需要靠近地面的发射物造成问题。因此发射物的此项功能被忽略。 /// CMoverMissile[%1]; Missiles only support the ground height map.  The air height map enables fliers to move smoothly over cliffs -- it offers no assistance to missiles and would only causes glitches in missiles that need to be near the ground.  It is therefore ignored on missiles.
